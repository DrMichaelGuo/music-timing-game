# Audio Assets

This folder contains audio files for the Rhythm Master game.

## Files:
- `metronome.mp3` - Metronome click sound for timing reference

## Adding Custom Sounds:
You can add custom sound files in the following formats:
- MP3 (recommended for compatibility)
- WAV (for higher quality)
- OGG (for smaller file sizes)

## Notes:
- The game will work without these audio files by using generated Web Audio API sounds
- Keep file sizes reasonable for web performance
- Consider using compressed audio formats for better loading times
